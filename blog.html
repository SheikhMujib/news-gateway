                                    functions?

                                <p>According to MDN, An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative
                                    to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this,
                                    arguments, super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited
                                    as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.

                                    There are 3 subtle differences in regular functions and arrow functions</p>

                                <h5>i) No own this bindings</h5>
                                <p>Arrow functions do not have their own this value. The value of this inside an arrow
                                    function is always inherited from the enclosing scope. the arrow function changed
                                    the this object outside its scope. The regular function just made the changes within
                                    its own this.</p>

                                <h5>ii) Arrow functions do not have a arguments array</h5>
                                <p>In JS arguments array in functions is a special object that can be used to get all
                                    the arguments passed to the function. Similar to this, arrow functions do not have
                                    their own binding to a arguments object, they are bound to arguments of enclosing
                                    scope.</p>

                                <h5>iii) Arrow functions are callable but not constructable</h5>
                                <p>If a function is constructable, it can be called with new, i.e. new User(). If a
                                    function is callable, it can be called without new (i.e. normal function call).

                                    Functions created through function declarations / expressions are both constructable
                                    and callable.

                                    Arrow functions (and methods) are only callable. class constructors are only
                                    constructable.

                                    If you are trying to call a non-callable function or to construct a
                                    non-constructable function, you will get a runtime error.</p>

                                <p>Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for
                                    multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for
                                    special constructs called tagged templates.

                                    Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are
                                    used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution
                                    of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it
                                    can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on
                                    the different parts of the template literal.</p>
